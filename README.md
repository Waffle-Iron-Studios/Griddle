# Welcome to the Griddle Engine

## Griddle Engine is an id Tech 1 centric source port for Waffle Iron Studios, Ltd.'s games

**Griddle** is a GZDoom fork that aims to better serve Waffle Iron Studio's freeware and commercial games.

While GZDoom is an advanced Doom engine and does this very well, Griddle aims to further separate itself.

This means adding features that may not align with GZDoom's goals, and discarding backwards compatibility with previous iterations of the engines, and existing mods, while still offering it's very capable core featureset.
