# Welcome to GZDoom!

## WIGZDoom is the fork of GZDoom used for Waffle Iron Studios, Ltd.'s id tech 1 derived games.

This mainly changes some default settings, removes the OpenGL ES 2.0 renderer, removes all non-free assets, and uses WIS Branding where possible.

It also uses in-development bugfixes and features our games might need.
